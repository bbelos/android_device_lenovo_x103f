# This file is the build configuration for a full Android
# build for toro hardware. This cleanly combines a set of
# device-specific aspects (drivers) with a device-agnostic
# product configuration (apps). Except for a few implementation
# details, it only fundamentally contains two inherit-product
# lines, full and toro, hence its name.
#

# Inherit from those products. Most specific first.

$(call inherit-product, device/lenovo/x103f/msm8909.mk)

# Discard inherited values and use our own instead.
